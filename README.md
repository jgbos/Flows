# KFuddles


    Oh what a layer-of-a-layer-of-a-layer-of!
    The sequence is the longest that's ever been heard of.
    So long and so fancy they'd be in a fix
    If they didn't have helpers.  It takes about six
    To tag along hoisting The-KFuddle-dee-Duddle's
    Wonderful sequence out of muddle-dee-puddles.
          --Adapted from Dr. Seuss, On Beyond Zebra
